Project Title  -  
Virtual agent (voice / chat bot) for Festo’s customer interaction center

Project Description -
The goal of this project is to develop a voice bot for Festo's customer interaction center that will improve customer experience and provide efficient and effective support to customers. The voice bot will be designed to interact with customers using spoken language and will be integrated with Festo's backend systems to retrieve customer information and logs to provide personalized and accurate responses to customers.

The voice bot will be developed using the latest artificial intelligence and speech recognition technologies to ensure it can accurately understand customer queries and provide the most appropriate responses. It will be designed to handle multiple languages and provide 24/7 system availability.

The voice bot will be integrated with Festo's customer relationship management system to enable it to retrieve customer information in real-time and provide personalized support. The integration will also ensure that the voice bot complies with all regulatory requirements and internal policies to ensure customer information safety.

Expected Outcome:
The successful development of this Virtual Agent will result in an improved customer experience for Festo's customers. The Virtual Agent will be able to handle a high volume of customer inquiries while delivering consistent and accurate responses. The Virtual Agent will also provide valuable insights into customer needs and preferences, helping Festo better understand and meet customer needs. Ultimately, the Virtual Agent will allow Festo to deliver a more efficient and effective customer interaction center, contributing to the company's overall success.

Project Requirements -
The project will require the development of a virtual agent that will be integrated into Festo's existing Customer Interaction Center. The virtual agent will be equipped with natural language processing (NLP) technology that can understand customer queries and provide relevant solutions promptly. The virtual agent should be able to respond to multiple queries simultaneously and handle different customer requests. The virtual agent should be designed to understand industry-specific language and terminologies related to Festo's products and services and provide appropriate solutions. The virtual agent must be user-friendly and interactive, capable of identifying customer preferences and providing personalized services.

Functional Requirements:

Design and development of a virtual agent: The voice bot should be able to accurately understand customer queries and provide the most appropriate responses.
Speech recognition: The voice bot must be able to accurately recognize and interpret spoken commands and queries.
Natural language processing (NLP): The voice bot should have NLP capabilities to understand the meaning of spoken phrases and respond appropriately. It should be also capable to understand industry-specific language and terminologies. 
Voice response: The voice bot must be capable of generating a natural-sounding voice response that is easy for users to understand.
Dialog management: The voice bot should be able to manage complex dialog and interact with users in a natural and engaging way. A combination of voice and chat functionality can be considered. The chat function should only leverage voice / understanding issue or provide further information like links to e.g. technical documentation, white papers etc. which won’t work via speech.
Integration with backend systems: The voice bot should be able to connect with backend systems to access data and provide responses based on that data. (planned for the future. For the project phase, Festo can provide needed data dumps to retrieve information)
Personalization: The voice bot should be able to personalize responses based on user history, preferences, and behavior.
Continuous learning: The voice bot should be able to learn from user interactions and improve its responses over time. Have a database of frequently asked questions (FAQs) and appropriate responses.
The voice bot should be able to handle multiple languages and provide 24/7 system availability.

Integration with the existing Customer Interaction Center is planned (but not in scope of the project)
User-friendly and interactive interface to be able to demo the virtual agent (voice / chat bot).
Web application could include an animated avatar who is talking to the customer in a natural language.
Can offer a combination of voice and chat functionality in case the voice cannot be understood then the avatar can ask the customer to type in some information for clarification.
Chat function can also give the possibility to share information with the customer like links etc.  which cannot be done via spoken language
Solution should have a monitoring and updating possibility for continual optimization.

Non-functional Requirements: 

Integration into Festo's existing technology: deployment on Festo’s AWS cloud
Performance: The voice bot should be able to respond quickly and reliably to user queries. Response times should be consistent and not vary with changes in the number of concurrent users or network traffic.
Scalability: The voice bot should be able to handle a growing number of users and requests without degrading performance. The system should be designed to scale horizontally or vertically in response to changing user loads.
Security: The voice bot should be designed with strong security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access. This could include measures such as encryption, secure authentication, and ensuring compliance with privacy regulations.
Maintainability: The system should be designed to be easy to maintain and update over time. This includes providing clear documentation, modularizing the system, and using industry-standard development practices.
Usability: The voice bot interface should be intuitive and easy to use, requiring minimal training or documentation for users to understand how to interact with it.
Reliability: The voice bot should be highly reliable, with minimal downtime or outages. The system should be designed with failover and redundancy to prevent disruptions in service.

Constraints:

Use existing data and infrastructure of the customer interaction center (needed data will be provided by Festo)
Speech recognition accuracy: The accuracy of speech recognition is heavily dependent on the quality of the audio input and the user's accent or language proficiency. These factors make it difficult to achieve high levels of accuracy, especially in noisy environments or with users who have strong accents. The expectation would be to use state-of-the-art services which can deliver the highest possible accuracy and user experience. (could be leveraged with a voice / chat combination in the user front-end or an optimized speech recognition)
Privacy and security compliance: Voice bots that collect and store user data must comply with Festo’s privacy and security regulations, such as GDPR.




Deliverables Summary:

At the end of the project, the following deliverables will be provided:

•	Design and development of a Virtual Agent using state-of-the art AI and natural language processing (NLP) technologies.
•	Fully functioning virtual agent (voice / chat bot) being able to handle different customer requests 
	Price and delivery information (requesting the price and the potential delivery date for part number or product tape codes or product names)
	Order tracking information (request information on an open order; provide open order number and want to know when it will be delivered or specific items will be delivered, etc.)
	Technical information (request for information on specific products, like documentations, advice for usage, etc.)
•	Concept for later integration with Festo’s Customer Interaction Center (optional)
•	Creation of a knowledge base and FAQs for the Virtual Agent.
•	Testing and evaluation of the Virtual Agent's performance. (Regular performance and progress reports)
•	Implementation and deployment of the Virtual Agent in Festo's AWS sandbox environment
•	Source code of the virtual agent available on GitLab
•	User manual and technical support guide for the virtual agent (including a demo video proving the capabilities)
