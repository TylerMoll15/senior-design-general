9/20/2023 - Team Meeting #2

**All in Attendance**

Done:
* Sent email to sponsor and TA
* Went through project requirements and possible roles each person would be assigned to throughout the project
* Decided to brush up on certain coding requirements that we may not be familiar with until we hear from Sponsor 

Need to do:
* Talk to sponsor (emailed on 9/19/2023, automated response saying one of them was out of office until 25th)
* Set meeting with TA Rohan, said we would start meeting next week, no response yet.
* Find out a meeting time with sponsor (they live in Germany so have to find a time that wouldn’t be too early for us or too late for them)
* Ask the sponsor if there’s any paperwork we need to sign since the project requires citizenship, etc.
